# movr
Moves files like only a caveman would :) 

# SCP bad

SCP is cool and all, but sometimes you have to connect 
to ssh through fifty shades of tunnels, and then 
it kinda sucks. The solution is simple: fork this repo,
commit your files to it, push them, pull 
them on your target machine. When you've
grabbed the files, we'll reset this repo to uncommit everything and return to a clean slate, ready to move files like a caveman again.

# How to tho?

## Add all files in directory:

```./movr add```

## Reset slate:

```./movr reset```
